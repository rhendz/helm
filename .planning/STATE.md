# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Helm can execute multi-step, approval-gated workflows reliably enough that workflow state, artifacts, and side effects remain durable and inspectable across restarts and failures.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Durable Workflow Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Durable Workflow Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-13 — Completed phase 1 plan 01 durable workflow persistence foundation

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 12 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 12 min | 12 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 12 min
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Initialization]: Focus v1 on the orchestration kernel rather than domain workflow expansion
- [Initialization]: Use a fixed weekly scheduling workflow to prove the kernel end to end
- [Initialization]: Keep approval mandatory before downstream create, update, or delete side effects
- [2026-03-13]: Keep durable workflow state in dedicated `workflow_*` tables instead of extending legacy email-specific persistence.
- [2026-03-13]: Freeze the final summary artifact contract early with nullable approval and downstream sync linkage fields.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 should choose a workflow schema vocabulary that does not duplicate existing email-specific artifact concepts unnecessarily.
- Phase 2 should validate how much LangGraph state Helm should own directly versus what remains inside graph persistence.
